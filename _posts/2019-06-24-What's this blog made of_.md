# What is this blog made of?

For a while now, I´ve been keen on building my web page/blog look alike. The initial intention was to force me to refresh some web development knowledge. I would say to even learn from scratch (more than update) all the fancy new tech. This industry tools change so fast, that what you might have learnt 7 years ago, it´s likely to be obsolete at the moment.

My requirements for the webpage/blog were:

-   Free or at least cheap.
    
-   Easy to update, time must be for complexity in the post´s content and nothing else.
    
-   Good looking page, professional appearance.
    
-   This will be (potentially) my future portfolio.
    

  

The way I found out about Github pages was through google. Saint Google always has the answer. You just need to be good at searching and Google replies back all you need plus a thousand things more that you don´t.

I found out that Github was giving free hosting/storage for static pages, aside from the traditional usage of keeping your code projects nice, tidy and under (version) control. And that something called Jekyll could run easily in Github pages. This unfamiliar framework called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) had the capability to run blog functionality.

Udemy courses work very well to have the first approach. Mostly because you just sit and watch someone explaining the basics instead of starting with a pile of documentation to decipher. Which you end up doing it anyway, but it makes it kinder. The course I chose it´s the following one: [https://www.udemy.com/static-website-generator-fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll/](https://www.udemy.com/static-website-generator-fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll/)

  
## Github: what is it?
Github is been out there for a while now. Wikipedia says it was founded in 2008, and still, it seems there is confusion around what´s Github and Git.

The own Github description says: GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

And in my own words, I would say it´s a fantastic website/graphic interface where you can share your Git managed projects.

Some of the terminologies might be a little bit confusing to start, like ‘repository’, or ‘branch’. Github people have your back, they´ve made some basic documentation which is very well explained.

And also… more documentation in-depth: [https://help.github.com/en](https://help.github.com/en)

  

Github also has a very complete Youtube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/githubguides](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides)

## Few key points

 Key concepts to be aware of, if I plant the seed of curiosity on you before to get started:

  -   No server-side language, only static pages.
    
-   Http not https, which restricts sensitive transactions like sending passwords, bank information, and all information of secret nature. In case that Http vs Https needs clarification, interesting infographic [link](%28https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/the-difference-between-http-and-https/%29). 
    
-   It can´t be used for reselling a site. It needs to be for personal use, which I believe refers to the specific case of developers selling websites hosted on Github. Otherwise, business pages can be hosted within Github pages.
    
-   There are 2 types: User/Organization pages and Project pages.
    
-   Source repository limit of 1GB.
    
-   And finally, there is a good behaviour code to control nasty usage of this free hosting.
    

## User/Organization or Project pages

The 2 types in a few discussion points. The main difference is that Project pages are connected to a project, while User or Organization pages are not necessarily linked to a single project. For instance, this entire blog is made under the premise of User/Organization page, but the web project is a different repository, which it has its own Project page. And so far, that works for me, hopefully, I don´t need to eat my words.

The domain name changes between options, in the User/Organization page you´ll be provided with `http://<username>.github.io` while in the Project pages: `http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`. It’s possible to use your own custom domain name very easily as I do.

Finally, what I would point the following as the decisive attribute of each type. You can have one User/Organization page, while you can have multiple Project pages. In addition to this, Github spoils us with unlimited free private repositories which they can create Project pages no problem. However, please keep in mind that the repositories might be private but the page will be public, and furthermore, the code will be accessible.
