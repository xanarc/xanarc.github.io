# What is this blog made of?

For a while now, I´ve been keen in building my web page/blog look alike. 
The initial intention was to force myself to refresh some web development knowledge. I would say to even learn from scratch (more than update). This industry tools change so fast, what you might have learnt 7 years ago, it´s totally obsolete at the moment. 

My requirements for the webpage/blog were: 

 - Free or at least cheap
 - Easy to update, time must be for complexity in the content and nothing else
 - Good looking page, professional work
 - This will be key as future portfolio

Saint Google always has the answer. You just need to be good at searching and Google replies back all you need and a thousand things more that you don´t. 
I found out that Github was giving free hosting/storage for static pages, aside from the traditional usage of keeping your code projects nice, tidy and under (version) control. And that something called Jekyll could run easily in Github pages. This unfamiliar framework called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) had the capability to run blog functionality.

I enjoy an Udemy course quite a bit to loosen up. Mostly because you just sit and watch someone explaining the basics instead of starting with a pile of documentation to decipher. Which you end up doing it anyway. 

The course I chose it´s the following one: [https://www.udemy.com/static-website-generator-fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll/](https://www.udemy.com/static-website-generator-fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll/)
